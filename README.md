# Movie Guessing Game

I love movies and I built this fun little app for those who like movies just as much as me. Click "Start" and see if which can guess which movie the scene belongs to.

Features to Add:
- narrow down a genre or categories to focus on and only use those scenes like ("Sci-Fi Movie Guessing Game" or "Alfred Hitchcock Guessing Game")
- Design landing page: design button, put start button in center, create background, design header
- Design game interface: center video and buttons, design buttons, add background
- Add timer to guessing game
- Keep score to see how many the user gets out of 10
